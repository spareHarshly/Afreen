        <span>Happy Birthday Chuzzziii</span>! You're one of the <span>best</span> people I have ever met, and I thank you for coming into my life. You know, when we first met, I told you that I wasn’t <span>happy</span> about where I studied and graduated. You told me that everything happens for a <span>reason</span> and that it’s all for the <span>best</span>. You were right—if I hadn’t studied at that <span>college</span>, I might not have met you. The <span>friends</span> I made there are the <span>reason</span> we are friends today. So yeah, maybe <span>destiny</span> wanted us to be <span>together</span>.
<br><br>
In 2023, after my <span>birthday</span>, when our <span>friendship</span> grew even stronger, you became my <span>best</span> birthday gift—this <span>friendship</span>. You already know I don’t usually take <span>online friendships</span> seriously, but then I met you, and we became friends. I’ve learned so much from this <span>friendship</span> and from you. I hope it lasts <span>forever</span> because I know some people leave without any <span>reason</span> and just stop talking.
<br><br>
So, in the end, I want to mention that you can be a bit of a '<span>roodu</span>' type sometimes. Just know that it’s okay to <span>cry</span>—it can make you feel <span>better</span>. But don’t waste your tears on people who don’t <span>deserve</span> them, or when you’re feeling <span>down</span>. Just be <span>happy</span> and enjoy your <span>life</span>. You also need to control your <span>overthinking</span> and stop worrying about what others might think of you because, honestly, no one really cares that much. You should focus on yourself and <span>love</span> yourself more than anyone else. And one more thing—if you’re going through something, please talk to me. It’s not right that we laugh together but don’t share our grief. If not with me, then talk to someone, because sharing your feelings will make you feel better.
<br><br>
You know, I really want to <span>meet</span> you, and the first thing I want to do is give you a <span>punch</span> on your face and then <span>tug</span> your hair—but I can’t. That’s why I don’t like <span>long-distance friendships</span>. No worries, though—one day we will <span>meet</span>. Until then, just <span>take care</span> of yourself.

        <span>Happy Birthday Afreen</span>, One of the <span>best</span> people I've met online 🥺. You know, I still wonder 🤔 why you followed me on the <span>Super sus</span> game because, as far as I remember, I didn't <span>talk</span> much at that time 🤐, and I was new to the <span>game</span> when you followed me. So, I don't know what you <span>saw</span> in me, but I do remember you talking about <span>destiny</span> 😁, that destiny wanted us to be <span>together</span> 😂. Whatever it was, I am happy now that today we are <span>friends</span> 😇.

        You know, I've seen that you have some <span>anger</span> issues 😠. So one thing I want to tell you is that I like to <span>mess</span> with people or <span>irritate</span> people 😁, and if I say something to you and you get <span>hurt</span> 🥺, just remember I didn't <span>mean</span> it 🥺. Okay, just talk to me, and I won't do it again 🥺 because anger doesn't look <span>good</span> on you. So just be <span>happy</span> and <span>smile</span> 🙂; it looks good on you. Although I haven't seen you, but still in my <span>imagination</span> 😂, you look good when you <span>smile</span>.

        Sometimes I think that the way I've <span>irritated</span> you, one day you probably will <span>block</span> me😅, but anyway, I will continue <span>irritating</span> you😁. And finally, I hope you get <span>everything</span> that you want ( only good things 😁), and your <span>dreams</span> come true one day. So be <span>happy</span> and be <span>proud</span> of yourself because you got this 🤗. <span>Happy Birthday Pookie Bear</span>🥳.
