        <span>Happy Birthday Afreen</span>, One of the <span>best</span> people I've met online 🥺. You know, I still wonder 🤔 why you followed me on the <span>Super sus</span> game because, as far as I remember, I didn't <span>talk</span> much at that time 🤐, and I was new to the <span>game</span> when you followed me. So, I don't know what you <span>saw</span> in me, but I do remember you talking about <span>destiny</span> 😁, that destiny wanted us to be <span>together</span> 😂. Whatever it was, I am happy now that today we are <span>friends</span> 😇.

        You know, I've seen that you have some <span>anger</span> issues 😠. So one thing I want to tell you is that I like to <span>mess</span> with people or <span>irritate</span> people 😁, and if I say something to you and you get <span>hurt</span> 🥺, just remember I didn't <span>mean</span> it 🥺. Okay, just talk to me, and I won't do it again 🥺 because anger doesn't look <span>good</span> on you. So just be <span>happy</span> and <span>smile</span> 🙂; it looks good on you. Although I haven't seen you, but still in my <span>imagination</span> 😂, you look good when you <span>smile</span>.

        Sometimes I think that the way I've <span>irritated</span> you, one day you probably will <span>block</span> me😅, but anyway, I will continue <span>irritating</span> you😁. And finally, I hope you get <span>everything</span> that you want ( only good things 😁), and your <span>dreams</span> come true one day. So be <span>happy</span> and be <span>proud</span> of yourself because you got this 🤗. <span>Happy Birthday Pookie Bear</span>🥳.
